# Welcome to the Data Structures Course Repository

Welcome to your class's repository! This repository is set up to grade your assignment submissions and get your evaluations.

## How It Works

### 1. Assignment Submission

- **Directory Structure:** Each student should submit their code in their own directory under `student_code/`. For example, if you are working on `activity1`, place your code in `student_code/activity1/`.

### 2. Auto-Evaluation

GitHub Actions will automatically evaluate your code as part of the continuous integration (CI) process:

- **Workflow Execution:** Each time you push changes to your repository, or open a pull request, the GitHub Actions workflows will trigger.
- **Evaluation Process:** The workflows will compile and test your code using predefined test cases.
- **Results:** You can view the results of the evaluation on the "Actions" tab of this repository. Look for the workflow run related to your submission.

### 3. Testing and Results

- **Test Cases:** Test cases are stored in the `test_cases/` directory and are used to validate your code. Ensure that your code handles all given test cases correctly.
- **Feedback:** Feedback on your code will be provided based on the results of the automated tests. Check the "Actions" tab for detailed feedback and evaluation results.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Navigate to Your Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repository/student_code/activity1/
   ```

3. **Add Your Code:** Place your `cpp` file in the appropriate directory.

4. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add my solution for activity1"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Monitor Evaluation Results:** Visit the "Actions" tab of this repository to view the status and results of your code evaluations.
